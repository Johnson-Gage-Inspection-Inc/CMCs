1 This laboratory offers commercial dimensional testing, calibration, and field calibration service.
2 Calibration and Measurement Capability Uncertainty (CMC) is the smallest uncertainty of measurement
that a laboratory can achieve within its scope of accreditation when performing more or less routine
calibrations of nearly ideal measurement standards or nearly ideal measuring equipment. CMCs represent
expanded uncertainties expressed at approximately the 95 % level of confidence, usually using a coverage
factor of k = 2. The actual measurement uncertainty of a specific calibration performed by the laboratory
may be greater than the CMC due to the behavior of the customer’s device and to influences from the
circumstances of the specific calibration.
3 Field calibration service is available for this calibration. Please note the actual measurement uncertainties
achievable on a customer's site can normally be expected to be larger than the CMC found on the A2LA
Scope. Allowance must be made for aspects such as the environment at the place of calibration and for
other possible adverse effects such as those caused by transportation of the calibration equipment. The
usual allowance for the actual uncertainty introduced by the item being calibrated, (e.g. resolution) must
also be considered and this, on its own, could result in the actual measurement uncertainty achievable on
a customer’s site being larger than the CMC.
4 The CMC is stated for calibrations performed in the field only.
5 In the statement of the CMC, L is the numerical value of the nominal length of the device measured in
