inches. In the statement of best uncertainty, D is the numerical value of the nominal diameter of the device
measured in inches; W is numerical value of the nominal applied mass in grams; and, R is the resolution
of the device under test.
6 This laboratory meets R205 – Specific Requirements: Calibration Laboratory Accreditation Program for
the types of dimensional tests listed above and is considered equivalent to that of a calibration.
7 The stated measured values are determined using the indicated instrument (see Comments). This
capability is suitable for the calibration of the devices intended to measure or generate the measured value
in the ranges indicated. CMC are expressed as either a specific value that covers the full range or as a
fraction or percentage of the reading plus a fixed floor specification.
8 This scope meets A2LA’s P112 Flexible Scope Policy.
9 The type of instrument or material being calibrated is defined by the parameter. This indicates the
laboratory is capable of calibrating instruments that measure or generate the values in the ranges indicated
for the listed measurement parameter.
